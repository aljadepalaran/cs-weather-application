# Weather Application

### What is it?
This is a weather application that parses data from a text file and places them into objects. The application displays the data in a suitable formaet and comes equipped with visualisation. The application is written in C# with the .NET framework.

The logo for the application belongs to the MET Office. It was used as a template and to enhance the overall look of the application. I did not make the logo or take credit for it.
